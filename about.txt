## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tareq

I'm a data science enthusiast with a deep curiosity for uncovering insights from data. This repository is a collection of everything I've practiced, explored, and learned on my journey into data science.

From basic data wrangling to building machine learning models, this space reflects my continuous effort to improve, experiment, and understand how data can drive decisions.

Data science, to me, is not just a fieldâ€”it's a mindset of asking the right questions, solving problems, and storytelling through numbers. Whether itâ€™s analyzing trends, cleaning messy data, or training predictive models, I enjoy the entire process of turning raw data into actionable insights.

If you're also passionate about data, feel free to explore the projects, suggest improvements, or just connect with me!

Letâ€™s keep learning, building, and sharing.
